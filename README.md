## OVERVIEW




The goal of this Organization is to bring a project called UPASTHITI - THE REAL CHECKER to life. UPASTHITI is an interactive attendance management system that enables the new normal experience of teaching and learning much better.It avoids wastage of time during online classes and checks presence of mind of students using its liveliness detection features.

## DONE TALKING, BUT HOW DOES IT WORKS?

The working of this project is quite simple - 

- The instructor generates a link , sends it in chats. 
- The link is given a window of about 10 sec. 
- After this time the link deactivates itself and stops working.
- During this span of 10 seconds, the students are required to open the link and bring their face at a suitable position so that it can be recognized. The image gets captured and is matched with the already present image of the student 's database. 
- If everything works well the student will be marked present in an excel sheet. 
- The teacher can send a link multiple times to keep a check on the attention of the student.

## What if a student shows picture?
Liveness detection! We caught you!

## What if there is a network issue?
If you are lying, we caught you again! We have a bandwidth check!

Sounds interesting? Do you find some other flaws? Then create an issue and letâ€™s discuss!

## Usage

Once done with the project setup, open the project in an [**IDE**](https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments); for example - [**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), etc.


**NOTE** : ***Be sure to select appropriate interpreter. Sometimes it may get deselected.***

### From Command Line Interface

* Create Virtual Environment
```
pip install virtualenv

python -m virtualenv myenv
```
### Mac / Linux User
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```
### Windows Users
```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

* Head to the project directory containing ```main.py```

* Open Terminal(Mac/Linux)/Command Prompt (Windows) there.

* Follow accordingly :arrow_down:

  1. **Unix Bash (Linux, Mac, etc.):**
  ```
  $ export FLASK_APP=main.py
  $ flask run
  ```
  2. **Windows CMD:**
  ```
  > set FLASK_APP=main.py
  > flask run
  ```
  3. **Windows PowerShell:**
   ```
  > $env:FLASK_APP = "1"
  > flask run
  ```
* ### Output:
```
 $ flask run
 Serving Flask app "hello"
 Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

 * Copy `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and open it in a browser and Voila!

> ***Without using shell***
> 1. Open `main.py`
> 2. Hit `Run`, if using any IDE as mentioned above.
